          <h2 id="title">MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
          <p id="para">
            Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, often referred to as the "Missile Man of
            India," was a renowned Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th
            President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he played a pivotal role in India's civilian
            space program and military missile development. Kalam was
            instrumental in the development of the Polar Satellite Launch
            Vehicle (PSLV) and the Agni and Prithvi missiles. Known for his
            humility, visionary ideas, and dedication to education and youth, he
            authored several books, including "Wings of Fire" and "India 2020."
            Dr. Kalam's legacy as a scientist, educator, and leader continues to
            inspire millions across the globe.

            As the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the
            Secretary of the DRDO, he played a crucial role in the Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.
            Despite his scientific achievements, Kalam was deeply committed to
            social issues, particularly in the field of education. He believed
            that the youth of India were the country's greatest asset and
            tirelessly worked towards their empowerment. During his presidency,
            Dr. Kalam earned the nickname "People's President" for his
            approachable nature and efforts to connect with the common man. He
            remained a prolific writer and speaker, delivering numerous lectures
            and writing books that continue to motivate and guide future
            generations. Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while
            delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
            leaving behind a legacy of innovation, integrity, and inspiration.
            His life story continues to remind us of the power of dreams and the
            importance of perseverance and hard work.
